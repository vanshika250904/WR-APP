# AI-Generated Wellness Recommendation Board

A personalized wellness application that generates AI-powered health recommendations based on user profiles. The app captures user information, generates customized wellness tips, provides detailed step-by-step guidance, and allows users to save their favorite recommendations.

## Project Setup

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Problem Understanding

The application solves the challenge of providing personalized wellness guidance by:

1. Capturing user demographics and wellness goals
2. Generating tailored health recommendations using AI-simulated logic
3. Providing actionable, step-by-step advice for each recommendation
4. Allowing users to save and revisit their favorite tips

**Assumptions Made:**
- Users may have multiple wellness goals (up to 3)
- Tips should be regenerable for variety and engagement
- Local persistence is sufficient for MVP (profile and favorites stored in localStorage)
- Age groups are categorized as: young adult (<30), middle-aged (30-49), senior (50+)
- Users prefer visual, card-based interfaces for browsing recommendations

```

### State Management

**Approach: React useState + Local Component State**

The application uses React's built-in `useState` hooks for state management, chosen for:
- Simplicity and minimal boilerplate
- Appropriate for the app's moderate complexity
- Direct and predictable data flow
- No external dependencies required

**State Architecture:**

```typescript
// App.tsx - Central State Management
const [currentScreen, setCurrentScreen] = useState<Screen>('profile');
const [profile, setProfile] = useState<UserProfile | null>(null);
const [tips, setTips] = useState<WellnessTip[]>([]);
const [selectedTip, setSelectedTip] = useState<WellnessTip | null>(null);
const [favorites, setFavorites] = useState<WellnessTip[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
```

**State Flow:**
1. **Profile State**: Captured from ProfileScreen, stored in localStorage, used for AI generation
2. **Tips State**: Generated by aiService based on profile, displayed in TipsScreen
3. **Selected Tip State**: Single tip selected for detailed view
4. **Favorites State**: Managed through storage utility, synced with localStorage
5. **Screen State**: Controls which screen component is rendered
6. **Loading State**: Manages loading indicators during async operations

**Why Not Redux/Context API?**
- App has simple, linear data flow (profile → tips → detail)
- No deeply nested component prop drilling
- State updates are straightforward and predictable
- Performance is not a concern with current component count

### Data Persistence

**LocalStorage Strategy:**
```typescript
// storage.ts
- saveProfile(profile): Store user profile
- getProfile(): Retrieve saved profile
- saveFavorites(favorites[]): Store favorites array
- getFavorites(): Retrieve saved favorites
- addFavorite(tip): Add to favorites
- removeFavorite(tipId): Remove from favorites
- isFavorite(tipId): Check favorite status
```

**Persistence Points:**
1. Profile saved immediately after capture
2. Profile auto-loads on app mount if exists
3. Favorites updated on every add/remove action
4. All data persists across browser sessions

### Component Architecture

**1. ProfileScreen**
- Controlled form inputs with validation
- Multi-select goal picker (max 3)
- Profile completion triggers tip generation
- Emits profile data upward to App

**2. TipsScreen**
- Receives tips array as props
- Card-based grid layout (responsive)
- Regenerate functionality
- Loading state during generation
- Each card clickable to view details

**3. DetailScreen**
- Lazy loads detailed content on mount
- Displays full explanation + step-by-step actions
- Favorite toggle functionality
- Back navigation to tips

**4. FavoritesScreen**
- Displays saved tips in card format
- Remove favorite functionality
- Click card to view full details
- Empty state handling

### AI Service

**Pattern: Mock AI with Realistic Delays**

```typescript
// aiService.ts
async generateTips(profile): Promise<WellnessTip[]>
  - Simulates AI processing (1.5s delay)
  - Template-based generation with profile injection
  - Returns 5 personalized tips

async generateDetailedTip(tip, profile): Promise<WellnessTip>
  - Simulates detailed generation (0.8s delay)
  - Adds step-by-step guidance
  - Profile-aware explanations
```

**AI Prompt Strategy:**
- Age group categorization for age-appropriate advice
- Gender consideration in workout recommendations
- Goal-specific customization in all tip content
- Combines user profile data into natural language explanations

**Future Enhancement:** Replace with actual OpenAI API or similar LLM service.
